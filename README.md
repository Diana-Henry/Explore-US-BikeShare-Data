# BikeShare Project
<p align="justify"> Explore US Bikeshre dataset by using Python to perform steps of the data analysis process on Bikeshare trip data collects from three US cities.The project compares the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Also, the project aims to see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.</p>

### Project details:

#### 1- The Datasets
> Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
 
> The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

#### 2- Statistics Computed:
> a- Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

> b-  Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

> c- Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

> d- User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
